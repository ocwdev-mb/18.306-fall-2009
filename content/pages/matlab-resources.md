MATLAB® Resources at MIT
------------------------

[Introduction to MATLAB](/courses/res-18-002-introduction-to-matlab-spring-2008), class materials that were developed by Yossi Farjoun of the MIT Department of Mathematics for a non-credit program during MIT's Independent Activities Period.  A collection of additional MATLAB resources are also linked from this web site, including teaching codes and tutorials.

MATLAB® Resources Elsewhere
---------------------------

[MATLAB demos](http://www.mathworks.com/products/demos/) by Mathworks

[MATLAB Primer](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~bdriver/21d-s99/matlab-primer.html): A tutorial by Dr. Kermit Sigmon, Department of Mathematics, at the University of Florida

[MATLAB](http://www.indiana.edu/~statmath/math/matlab/) resources at Indiana University

[A Practical Introduction to MATLAB](http://www.math.mtu.edu/~msgocken/intro/intro.html) by Mark S. Gockenbach, Department of Mathematical Sciences, at Michigan Technological University. These notes are a good starting point. The section on "Simple calculations and graphs" is particularly appropriate for help in getting started.
